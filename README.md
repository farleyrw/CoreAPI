# CoreAPI

This project is meant to serve as a testing ground for .Net Core 3+ Web API.  I will rebuild things I've built previously in .Net Framework.

In it I will build framework level features to support
- generic persistence
- base classes
- error handling
- logging
- generic dependency registration
- model validation
- startup configuration

And more!
